# My Arch Dotfiles

All my dotfiles configs are stored here so that I could recreate, reconfigure or install stuff easily next time.

### To avoid annoying directory problems, make sure to save the repo (_'My-Arch-Dotfiles'_ folder) to:

`~/Documents/GitHub/` so it should look like this: `~/Documents/GitHub/My-Arch-Dotfiles/` _Note: Create directories whenever necessary._

## Installing the required stuff
1. All my installed packages are found in [here](./other/installed packages.txt)
