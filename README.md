# My Arch Dotfiles

All my dotfiles configs are stored here so that I could install them easily next time

## To avoid annoying directory problems, make sure to save your repo (_'My-Arch-Dotfiles'_ folder) to:

`~/Documents/GitHub/` so it should look like this: `~/Documents/GitHub/My-Arch-Dotfiles/`

\* Create directories whenever necessary.
